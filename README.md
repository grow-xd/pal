To contribute to this project, simply follow the procedure described below:

### 1. Find an issue

- Choose an issue from the ones already there or establish your own to begin contributing.
- You can start working on the issue once a maintainer assigns it to you!😎

### 2. Fork and clone the repository

- Create a copy of the forked repository on your machine. This will duplicate the repository on your personal computer. Run the following command after copying the forked repository link:
```bash
git clone <cloning URL>
```
- Change your current directory to the directory of the project repository.
```bash
cd <project_directory>
```
- To guarantee that your local copy is up to date, add a reference to the source repository.
```bash
git remote add upstream <source repository URL>
``` 

### 3. Create a new branch

- Make a fresh branch. Choose a name that accurately describes the issue you are resolving. The command that comes after will start a new branch and switch to it.

```bash
git checkout -b Branch_Name
```

### 4. Work on your chosen issue!!! 👨‍💻

git add .  

# To add only a few files to Branch_Name
git add <some files>
```

### 5. Commit your changes

```bash 
git commit -m "message"  
```

### 6. Sync the fork with your local copy

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout Branch_Name
git merge upstream/main
```

### 7. Push your changes
